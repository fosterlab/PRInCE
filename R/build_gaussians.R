#' Deconvolve profiles into Gaussian mixture models
#' 
#' Identify peaks in co-fractionation profiles by deconvolving peaks in 
#' Gaussian mixture models. Models are mixtures of between 1 and 5 Gaussians.
#' Profiles are pre-processed prior to building Gaussians by filtering and 
#' cleaning. By default, profiles with fewer than 5 non-missing points, or 
#' fewer than 5 consecutive points after imputation of single missing values,
#' are removed. Profiles are cleaned by replacing missing values with 
#' near-zero noise, imputing single missing values as the mean of neighboring 
#' points, and smoothing with a moving average filter. 
#' 
#' @param profile_matrix a numeric matrix of co-elution profiles, with proteins
#' in rows, or a \code{\linkS4class{MSnSet}} object
#' @param min_points filter profiles without at least this many total, 
#' non-missing points; passed to \code{\link{filter_profiles}}
#' @param min_consecutive filter profiles without at least this many 
#' consecutive, non-missing points; passed to \code{\link{filter_profiles}}
#' @param impute_NA if true, impute single missing values with the average of
#' neighboring values; passed to \code{\link{clean_profiles}}
#' @param smooth if true, smooth the chromatogram with a moving average filter;
#' passed to \code{\link{clean_profiles}}
#' @param smooth_width width of the moving average filter, in fractions;
#' passed to \code{\link{clean_profiles}}
#' @param max_gaussians the maximum number of Gaussians to fit; defaults to 5.
#' Note that Gaussian mixtures with more parameters than observed (i.e., 
#' non-zero or NA) points will not be fit. Passed to  
#' \code{\link{choose_gaussians}}
#' @param criterion the criterion to use for model selection;
#' one of "AICc" (corrected AIC, and default), "AIC", or "BIC". Passed to
#' \code{\link{choose_gaussians}}
#' @param max_iterations the number of times to try fitting the curve with
#' different initial conditions; defaults to 50. Passed to 
#' \code{\link{fit_gaussians}}
#' @param min_R_squared the minimum R-squared value to accept when fitting the
#' curve with different initial conditions; defaults to 0.5. Passed to 
#' \code{\link{fit_gaussians}}
#' @param method the method used to select the initial conditions for
#' nonlinear least squares optimization (one of "guess" or "random"); 
#' see \code{\link{make_initial_conditions}} for details. Passed to 
#' \code{\link{fit_gaussians}}
#' @param filter_gaussians_center true or false: filter Gaussians whose centres
#' fall outside the bounds of the chromatogram. Passed to 
#' \code{\link{fit_gaussians}}
#' @param filter_gaussians_height Gaussians whose heights are below this 
#' fraction of the chromatogram height will be filtered. Setting this value to
#' zero disables height-based filtering of fit Gaussians. Passed to 
#' \code{\link{fit_gaussians}}
#' @param filter_gaussians_variance_min Gaussians whose variance falls below 
#' this number of fractions will be filtered. Setting this value to
#' zero disables filtering. Passed to 
#' \code{\link{fit_gaussians}}
#' @param filter_gaussians_variance_max Gaussians whose variance is above
#' this number of fractions will be filtered. Setting this value to
#' zero disables filtering. Passed to 
#' \code{\link{fit_gaussians}}
#' 
#' @return a list of fit Gaussian mixture models, where each item in the 
#' list contains the following five fields: the number of Gaussians used to fit
#' the curve; the R^2 of the fit; the number of iterations used to 
#' fit the curve with different initial conditions; the coefficients of the 
#' fit model; and the curve predicted by the fit model. Profiles that 
#' could not be fit by a Gaussian mixture model above the minimum R-squared 
#' cutoff will be absent from the returned list.
